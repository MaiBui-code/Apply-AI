# Apply-AI

This is a project doing in Apply AI Program using a dataset in Kaggle to classify the blood clot origins in ischemic stroke. Using whole slide digital pathology images, you'll build a model that differentiates between the two major acute ischemic stroke (AIS) etiology subtypes: cardiac and large artery atherosclerosis.

In this program, we use EfficientNetB0 and ResNet as the architecture for Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) - Deep Learning algorithm f
